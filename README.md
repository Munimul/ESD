# ESD (Empty Space Detection)

This repository is part of the project where empty spaces in retail environments can be detected using machine learning model. Yolov7 has been used to train and detect the empty spaces. For dataset, a smaller version of SKU-110k has been used. All the images in our dataset has been labelled using LabelImg tool. Due to the small size of our labelled dataset we have applied some data augmentation techniques to increase the data in our train set. We have achieved 76.1%mAP@.5 from our small dataset.
